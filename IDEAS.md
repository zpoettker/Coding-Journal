Things I would like to build:
- Game-Show Game:
  I have always been interested in the 3 doors seconds chance to stay with original quess or change doors math, and would like to build a simulation of this, to test out the math, maybe to keep score of different strategies

- CYOA Game:
I am currently creating a CYOA game on freecodecamp and want to create my own with what I learn, but add visuals with what is happening, aswell as more options and paths todo

I think I'll be able to make it a really cool and fun game, may stick to the mideval theme, may not.
